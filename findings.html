        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
            The reason I decided to do this in html is because everyone has access to html regardless of their OS, and I don't really want to buy a subscription to MS Word.
            I have left number of commands in the main script so that you could check my work if you so wished. I have used dependency inversion,
            though I don't think this works particularly well for dynamically typed languages like python.

            To improve it could be possible to create a factory patterm which would handle things like how the data is read into a dataframe, be it from JSON,excel etc, but that is beyond the scope of this demo.
            For the sake of keeping my sanity I had only included 3 of the 10 Most and least paid earners. I didn't want to make the html table extremely long.For more information please look through my scripts.

                VP being the most lucrative position I looked at what kind of data I could find.
                Mean salary for a VP was 477500.0. There were 6 VPs in the data sent and all but 1 were on mortgage, the 1 who wasn't owned their home.

            Nail tech getting paid 0.0 is probably a mistake but I have decided to leave this in.
            Mean salary for the least paid workers was 4465.5. Unfortunately none of the workers in the top 10 were home owners.
